Data from Marcotte et al 2016. Per gene log2 FPKM was Quantile-Normalized, and a floor value set at log2(0.1) FPKM.Per gene zGARP score was served as gene essentiality scores. CBS-segmented SNP array Log R-Ratios(mapped to genes) were used as CNA scores.Mutation data shows the result of exome sequencing of genes mutant at >3% in breast tumors(TCGA, COSMIC). SUM229 doesn't have mutation data. 3 ER+ILC cells lines MDAMB134, MDAMB330, SUM44 are in the dataset.
