bind.Rda and primary_tpm.Rda are too large to add to github. They have the same format as normal_tpm, with primary_tpm also having pam50 designations.
bind.Rda contains a duplicate copy of primary_tpm, with er_status_by_ihc, pam50, and histology categories defined as tumor, to allow for the adjacent-normal vs tumor comparisons
