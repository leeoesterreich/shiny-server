Shows gene expression in LTED cell lines

Data from Simigdala et al, BCR 2016. WT parental cells are cutured in RPMI pheno red free +10%FBS+1nM E2. Parental cells undergone 1 week hormone deprivation, WT parental, and LTED cells were performed microarray.For lab LTED, parental cell lines were hormone deprived for 3 days before RNASeq. Salmon and DESeq2 were used to map reads to genes and select the differentially expressed genes. SUM44F is used as SUM44 parental cells"
